# Architecture


## Architecture Overview

- Apps, website 
- Account Service
- Student authentication
- Scalability 
- Privacy -> approximated details
- Google Maps Api
- Calendar Integration
- Notifications
- Organization Service

## Frameworks

Consideration that needs to be done:
 - What framework provides application and website
 - Scalability?
 - Something that is easy to use, and is well documented.

Flutter -> Dart Backend -> Hive
React Native -> Javascript/TS Backend

MySql? -> Firebase? -> MongoDb?


## Infrastructure

If we're running Flutter/ Dart we should use GCP to host our backend.

## External Apis

Google Maps Api -> Google Calendar Api

## Authentication

OAuth2.0

## Scalability

Literally no clue, I'll look into it.

## Student Auth

Student emails to login, and to verify that they are a student.

## Account Service

Database to store user information

- Sign up, login, logout, update profile, delete account
- Create, update, delete, view runs
- Create, update, delete, view organizations
- Create, update, delete, view teams
- Create, update, delete, view leagues
- Create, update, delete, view tournaments
- Create, update, delete, view stats

OAuth2.0
Email verification
Password reset
Password hashing

WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STORE PASSWORDS SAFELY 

## Organization Service


## Privacy

End to end encryption?????
